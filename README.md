Speed bus is a small game made, initially, for the Mini Game Jam 95 which had the theme of *chance*.

To impliment this theme in the game, I decided to interpret the *chance* by centering the game around using "chance" bars where players had to perfectly time their inputs in order to succeed in the game.

To be honest, this usage of the theme is a bit of a stretch but I made it work.
